# weather-dashboard

## Purpose

This week we were asked to build a weather dashboard using data from a weather api. The dashboard would allow for user input (location) and click a search button. Upon search, current weather information for the desired city would populate the screen. Along with the current weather, a 5 day forecast would be shown.

## Comments

I could not figure out how to get the five day forecast cards to populate.
